# where-it-all-started

All of the coding lectures and practices I have written in Turkish back when I have started learning programming with C. Some of the content within these files may be unfiltered, sloppy, and poorly written. Nevertheless, for the sake of authenticity and nostalgia, I will keep them as it is. I think it may be a good reference for people who want to learn programming but don't know where to start and stumble upon this by chance.



## Run on Terminal

```sh
gcc "insert_filename_here.c" -o test
test
```
