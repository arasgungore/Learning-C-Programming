# where-it-all-started

An archive containing all of the Turkish C coding lectures and exercises I have written back when I have started learning programming. In this archive, there is a total of over 10,000 lines of C code written using Dev-C++. Honestly, some of the content within these files may be unfiltered, cringe, and poorly written. Nevertheless, for the sake of authenticity and nostalgia, I will keep them as it is. I also think it may be a good reference for people who want to learn programming but don't know where to start and stumble upon this "pile of codes" by chance.



## Run on Terminal

```sh
gcc 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡_𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒_ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒.c -o test
